                <p>My hobbies include gaming, designing, and playing with my two dogs.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm a graphic design student at MCC. I hope to graduate from MCC in Spring 2025 and transfer to Roosevelt University at the MCC University Center.

                        <li>My favorite color is yellow!</li>
                            <li>My favorite Pokemon is a tie between Pikachu and Psyduck!</li>
                                <li>I have a scar on my left hand from testing the claim “It's easy to slip in the shower” when I was 8</li>

                <p>After I graduate with a Bachelors in Graphic Design, I plan on becoming a UI designer.
<br><br>
                    User interfaces and user experience has always been quite interesting to me. I love studying why designs work and why they don't.
                    <br><br>
                    Games in particular are full of both good and bad UI designs. My favorite UI designs in games include Persona 5 and NieR:Automata.
