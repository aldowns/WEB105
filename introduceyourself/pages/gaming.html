            <p>I love to play games that provide an outlet for my own creativity.</p>

                <h2>Stardew Valley</h2>
                <p>The definition of cozy gaming, Stardew Valley, is one of my favorite games. For 15 dollars I have gotten over 500 hours of playtime on my PC and I was happy to purchase it again for both my phone and my Switch. <br><br>It is not as customizable as Animal Crossing as it is a farming simulator at its core. But the relaxed, go-at-your-own-pace nature of the game keeps me coming back for more.</p>

                <h2>Animal Crossing New Horizons</h2>
                <p>There are many outlets for creativity within Animal Crossing. I've played the series since I was five, starting with the original game on Gamecube.
                New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch gave me many tools to create clothes and decorate my own world.<br><br>
                Although I found the character dialogue lacking compared to other games, the improved customization abilities give me a reason to go back to it every now and again; even when I prefer the charm of the older games.</p>
