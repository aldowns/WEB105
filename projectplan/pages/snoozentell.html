                    <h2>AI + Dreams...</h2>
                    <p>
                    "Snooze n' Tell" was a branding project for a mock company I envisioned. I was tasked with creating a brand guide, website concept, and logo.</p>
<br>
                    <p>The idea behind Snooz n' Tell was inspired by the AI "hype" in 2023. The basic idea was a service that offered AI-powered dream interpretations.
                        The main problem I needed to solve as a designer that I immediately identified with this product was the users' lack of trust towards the technology. I needed an answer to the question, "Why would I trust a company with my dreams?".
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The solution I developed can be broken down into three aspects:
                        - Color palette
                        - Usability
                        - Mascot
                        </p>
<br>
                    <p>I first chose a simple purple color scheme as it is the color most associated with sleep and tranquility. I then considered how exactly the user would input information. I decided on a chatbox because of its approachability.
                    </p>
<br>
                    <p>Finally, I observed other application mascots and what their function was. Duolingo's "Duo" was an encouraging face; challenging and encouraging users to come back for more lessons each day. Microsoft's "Clippy" was used as a way to guide users through a brand new, somewhat scary technology at the time. Snooz n' Tell warranted a mascot character as it faced both "consistency" and "new technology" as it's challenges.
